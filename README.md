## Inputs

### `folder_id`

Required: **YES**.

The **ID of the folder** you want to upload to.

##### How to Find the `Folder ID`

To find the `Folder ID`, look at the URL of your Google Drive folder. For example:

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/xxxx
```

Here, the `Folder ID` is the part after `/folders/`, which in this case is `xxxx`.

### `service_account`

Required: **YES**.

A base64-encoded string of the Google Cloud Service Account Key.

1. Access the `Google Cloud` `Credentials` page:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Create a new `Service Account`.
3. Generate a new `JSON` key.
4. Convert the key to base64 using:
   ```bash
   cat service_account_key.json | base64 > service_account_key_base64.txt
   ```
5. Add the base64 string as a secret in your GitHub account (or organization).

### `source_path`

Required: **YES**.

The local path to the file(s) to upload.

### `destination_path`

Required: **NO**.

The destination path in Google Drive.

### `upload_cutoff`

Required: **NO**.

The cutoff size for switching to chunked uploads. This allows large files to be uploaded without encountering HTTP 429 errors.
